        <h2>Team Analysis</h2>
        <p>This tool helps analyze and predict sports team performance using historical data. Users can select a team from a list. 
            The model is trained using features like year, win-loss percentage, points scored per game, points allowed per game, and simple rating page (SRS) to predict the number of wins the team is likely to achieve in the next season.</p>
        <p>The tool then shows the estimated number of wins for the upcoming year, which can be useful for team management, fans, and analysts to make decisions regarding strategy, recruitment, and fan engagement.</p>
