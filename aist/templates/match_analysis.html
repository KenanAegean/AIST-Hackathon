    <h2>Match Analysis (2021)</h2>
    <p>This page helps users predict 
        <b class="text-primary" style="display: inline;">match outcomes</b>
         by analyzing historical team statistics. 
        Users pick two teams from a dropdown menu on a webpage and submit their choices. The page then sends these team names to the server.</p>
    <p>Using 
        <b class="text-primary" style="display: inline;">logistic regression</b>
        , the page analyzes stats like 
        <b class="text-primary" style="display: inline;">win-loss percentage, points scored and allowed per game, and Simple Rating page (SRS)</b> 
        for the selected teams. 
        These stats are pulled from a database. The page trains a model using these features and predicts the probabilities of each team winning. Users see these predicted probabilities, helping them make informed decisions about the match's potential outcome.</p>
